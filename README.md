# ShittyProject

it started out as an idea for a game, but turned into a single project serving as a dump for a bunch of different mechanics working together on some level. The quality of different elements varies greatly depending on how much time and effort actually went into it. Some aspects, such as visuals (animations, lighting) have been almost completely disregarded

- extensive door and teleportation system along with keys, electronic locks etc
- HUD, along with stats, stamina system
- loading screens that actually appear on loading insted of only pretending to do something
- saving progress in key moments
- system for throwing objects and combat is also included, but the animations are a complete disaster - i'm not an animator
- basic AI with behaviour trees 
- interaction system based on line tracing
- widgets for interactive objects
- universal damage processing system
- minigames
- start and pause menu
- basic SFX and VFX
...
- a lot of tears and frustration
